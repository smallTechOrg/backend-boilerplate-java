## Prerequisites

### Setup IntelliJ IDE
We are not only going to use IntelliJ's IDE as a code editor,
but we will also be using to install and maintain different Java runtimes.

### Install Java
Install Java using the IntelliJ console.
Refer `.tool-versions` for the exact java version.

### Build using Gradle
Once you have downloaded the JDK onto IntelliJ, you can build using gradle.
You can do this via the GUI or via this command:
```declarative
./gradlew build
```
